    Air pollution is THE environmental topic that European citizens worry about most.¹
    It is responsible for 400,000 premature deaths in Europe each year, 
    and puts considerable damage to agriculture as well as our natural environment.²
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite these facts the readiness and power of European citizens to take actions themselves is limited.
    This is were CAPTOR comes in. We want to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>aEngage a network of local communities for monitoring tropospheric ozone pollution.</li>
    <li>Install a network of low-cost sensors to measure tropospheric ozone pollution, designed and maintained by European citizens in these local communities.</li>
    <li>Provide high quality and reliable data about tropospheric ozone poulltion from the low-cost sensor network.</li>
    <li>To engage the local communities in a collaborative learning process about air pollution, supporting a bottom-up process of defining and designing measures for action.</li>
    <li>To empower citizens and engage them in promoting behavioural changes and active participation in decision making to drive solutions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>  
    CAPTOR is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme and started in January 2016.
