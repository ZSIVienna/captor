This is were CAPTOR comes in. We want to:</p><ul><li>Engage a network of local communities for monitoring tropospheric ozone pollution.</li><li>Install a network of low-cost sensors to measure tropospheric ozone pollution, designed and maintained by European citizens in these local communities.</li><li>Provide high quality and reliable data about tropospheric ozone poulltion from the low-cost sensor network.</li><li>To engage the local communities in a collaborative learning process about air pollution, supporting a bottom-up process of defining and designing measures for action.</li><li>To empower citizens and engage them in promoting behavioural changes and active participation in decision making to drive solutions.</li></ul><p> CAPTOR is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme and started in January 2016.</p><h1>More information will follow soon here.</h1><p> Interested to keep in touch with us and follow our activities?<br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Oj-Pw1VYGC-lXsuLTkQut9Bfip7tHIJK5Ns8hMB0yZM"> Here is a form to sign to our newsletter or tell us what you are interested in. </a></p></div></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><div class="wrapper"> <span class="footer-addon"> ¹ Attitudes of European Citizens towards the Environment“, 2014, Special Eurobarometer 416 / Wave EB81.3<br> ² http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air </span></div> </footer></body></html>
